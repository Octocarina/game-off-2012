The game is self-contained; you don't need to read any of the explanations below to figure out how to play.


## Game mechanic: Revert changes, replay changes

This is a puzzle game in which you carry a fork, push blocks, and go back in time.

In git-speak, the Master Fork allows you to work on a tempory branch, to cherry-pick a subset of the block pushes you perform inside that branch, then to rebase those changes onto the master branch. **Important**! You do *not* not to understand the previous sentence in order to have fun playing the game.


## Art Credits

I am using PlanetCute, a [free tileset](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html) generously offered by Daniel Cook for the express purpose of *not* making yet another Sokoban clone. Which this game kind of is, before you start using the Master Fork. Sorry, Danc! Anyway, [his blog](http://www.lostgarden.com/) is a great source of insight for independent games developers.

I also borrow a character from <a href="http://doctor-gus.deviantart.com/">Doctor-Gus</a>, an artist who makes jewelry out of forks. But I can't tell you which character without spoiling the ending.
